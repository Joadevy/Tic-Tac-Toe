## Overview
This is my first project after learning in depth some concepts of the javascript language. I've created it so as to put the knowledge into practice because it's the way to acquire and really understand the things I've learned before. I chose to start with an 'easy' project for the first time and because I want to create many things using different concepts of JS. 

### The challenge
Basically consists in a Tic Tac Toe game aplying concepts of HTML/CSS/JS. I had to take a lot of decisions in order to make the game fuctional. At the beggining it was a bit difficult because my brain was blocked with the empty js code, I didn't know the way to start coding but then I quickly started to think about it and organize the ideas in a Notion page. Finally I got the result I had thought so I'm proud with my work and I like it.

## My process
I've chosen the idea in a twitch stream of a really good developer and teacher [@goncy](https://www.twitch.tv/goncypozzo). Then I thought about all the logic of the game by myself so probably it's not the most optimal way to do it but it works (I assure you). Finally I put in practice my CSS skills once again to design the web and make it visually atractive using a minimalist design.

### Built with

- Desktop first workflow
- Responsive design
- Flexbox/Grid concepts
- Control version system using Git
- JavaScript vanilla

### What I learned
This is my first project in JavaScript so I learned a lot of it and the way to work with the DOM. Before this project in the university I worked with others programming languages but not web-oriented so it's a new field for me in this way. I started with an idea and I was be able to get it, I felt confortable using JS and I got the things that I wanted to do. I'll keep working and improving on it.

### Continued development
I'm really excited to keep learning about frontend technologies, specially more about of javascript in order to create dynamic webs and amazing web-experiences.
